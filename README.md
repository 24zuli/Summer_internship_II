# Summer_Internship_II : The Complete Quantum Computing Course for Beginners  

## ðŸ“Œ **Overview**  
This repository documents my learning journey through the **Packt â€“ Complete Quantum Computing Course for Beginners (Coursera Specialization)**.  
The specialization blends theory and practice, taking learners from the **mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics** to **hands-on implementation of algorithms in Qiskit**. Over the span of ~1 month of structured study (~30â€“35 hours), I explored the principles of qubits, quantum gates, entanglement, teleportation, and advanced algorithms such as **Deutsch, Bernstein-Vazirani, Groverâ€™s, and Shorâ€™s**.
